# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-Twitter


Methodology:
The following Module will involve in the methodology:
o Module 1
Extraction of the Tweets form twitter, which are going to be analyzed in future.
o Module 2
Cleaning of the Tweets to make them recognizable for the machine to understand.
The informal comments of dataset need to be removed, while some comments will be
used them wherever possible.
o Module 3
Now we will implement the machine learning algorithm along with the feature
vectorization to label the algorithm with the pre-analysis knowledge. Now the
processed data go throw the polarity determination of the tweets as per their intended
sentiments
